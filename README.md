# Overview

This repository is work related to setting up HERE (here.com) server dev work station.

# Repository Directories

To be filled in shortly

- `cookbooks/` - Cookbook dependencies via `berks vendor ./cookbooks

# Configuration

install virtualbox  
install chef workstation  
download HERE server bits using your account  
download java for HERE  
download tomcat for HERE  


# Next Steps

Right now mounted folders are specific to MY machine and will most definitely not work for you. This is something that will be addressed later  
Chef Cookbook is very simple. I didn't want to fight Tomcat or java cookbooks as they seem to be either end of life, abandoned, or require too much troubleshooting.
